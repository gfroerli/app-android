<p>The app "Gfrör.li" displays current water temperatures of Swiss lakes and
rivers in dozends of different locations. Ideal for temperature-sensitive
people that still like swimming outside when the temperature is sufficiently
high!</p>

<p>The data displayed comes from our community-operated LoRaWAN based measuring
stations and is updated multiple times per hour. Additionally, we integrate
data from public measuring stations (like from the Swiss FOEN) when the license
permits us to do so. You can find more information about the project at <a
