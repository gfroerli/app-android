<p>The app "Gfrör.li" displays current water temperatures of Swiss lakes and
rivers. Ideal for temperature-sensitive people, that still like swimming
outside! Currently we have sensors in Lake Zürich and in Lake Lucerne. More
sensors will follow.</p>

<p>The data is coming from our own LoRaWAN based measuring stations and are
updated multiple times per hour. You can find more information about the open
source project at <a href="https://gfrör.li/">gfrör.li</a>.<p>
