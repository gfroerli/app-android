    <!-- About activity -->
    <string name="about_project_heading">Why this app?</string>
    <string name="about_project_text1">The water temperature is a value relevant to a lot of people: Swimmers, divers, fishermen, and many others. But until now, there were no reliable ways to get real time information about the water temperature in the area you\'re interested in.</string>
    <string name="about_project_text2">Today there are already some water temperature sensor networks, but usually there is only one sensor per lake (ignoring temperature differences for example near the mouth of a cold river) and it is often published only once per day.</string>
    <string name="about_project_text3">We are building a network of low-cost low-energy water temperature sensors. This allows us to measure the water temperature locally and to show it to you in real time, for free.</string>
    <string name="about_us_heading">Who made this app?</string>
    <string name="about_us_text1">This app, the server infrastructure as well as the water temperature sensor hardware is developed by the Coredump hackerspace in Rapperswil-Jona.</string>
    <string name="about_us_text2">Find more information about us on our website: <a href="https://www.coredump.ch/">www.coredump.ch</a></string>
    <string name="open_source_heading">Open Source</string>
    <string name="open_source_text1">This app is open source! You can find the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gfroerli/app-android">github.com/gfroerli/app-android</a></string>
